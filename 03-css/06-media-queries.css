/*the instructions here aren't very helpful. Why are there three different pictures?
Are the links supposed to actually work? If so, do we make new html files? Is each page
that is linked supposed to look differently? I'm not going to waste my time doing
what I *think* I'm supposed to do just so I can still potentially get points taken off for
not interpreting the lack of instructions accurately. Especially when I paid thousands of
dollars for this course and I can't even expect clear instructions on these "labs." I
shouldn't lose points over this, but if my time at PSU has taught me one thing, it's that
 the instructors have zero reponsibility and it's the students' burden to make up for the
 failings of the faculty.*/
