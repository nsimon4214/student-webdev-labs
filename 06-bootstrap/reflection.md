Q: Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
videos or the solutions for help?

A: I looked at the solutions repo because I couldn't understand what I was supposed to do for some of it.

Q: How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
exercise that was particularly helpful?

A: Not very helpful, most of the time I was just trying to figure out what I was supposed to do because all we had to go off were images.

Q: Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

A: Yeah, the instructions were nonexistant, there were only images with no explanation. It was kind of impossible to do these without either guessing, looking at the repo, or watching the videos. We were led to believe that we could do these on our own if we wanted to but there is a severe lack of direction. Even the solutions repo wasn't helpful and is really disorganized.

Q: Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s
topic a little better?

A: No
