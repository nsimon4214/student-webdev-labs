### HTML

**Q:** Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
videos or the solutions for help?

**A:** I tried to do these on my own, but then I looked at the solutions repo, which honestly didn't really help.

**Q:** How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
exercise that was particularly helpful?

**A:** Not very, it was hard to decipher the instructions.

**Q:** Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

**A:** Yes, the instructions weren't very helpful because the images we were supposed to match didn't make sense.

**Q:** Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s
topic a little better?

**A:** No.
